# Fruits Categorization with a surport vector machine (SVM) classifier

**The classifier is trained by my dataset, which is able to distinguish six different fruits. They are apple, banana, kiwi, cherry, walnut, and orange. The BSc dissertation is available [here](https://github.com/Lucas-ZhipengLiu/Fruits-Categorization-with-SVM-/blob/master/%E5%88%98%E5%BF%97%E9%B9%8F-%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E7%BB%88%E7%A8%BF.pdf). Below is an overview of the project**

## Feature extraction
Using OpenCV function to delete background and calculate color (RGB), size, perimeter and radian information of a fruite.

## Build my dataset
I took about 40 images for each fruit (6*40=240 images in total), and calculated color (RGB), size, perimeter and radian information of each image.
